Fixing the Windows Activation Loop

1 Restart your computer. You can choose this option from the Start menu, 
  or you can simply hold down your computer's power button until it turns
  itself off and then press the button again.

2 Tap F8 as soon as your computer logo appears. You'll need to do this during
  the first time the logo appears after rebooting. Keep tapping F8 until you see
  the advanced options menu pop up.

3 Use the arrow keys to select Safe Mode with Command Prompt. Starting up your
  computer in this mode will bypass the Windows activation loop long enough for
  you to reset the timer for your XP trial.

4 Tap ↵ Enter. You'll need to wait a minute or so for Safe Mode to load.

5 Type "explorer.exe" into the Command Prompt program. Exclude the quotation marks.

6 Tap ↵ Enter. You should see a dialogue window pop up after doing so.
  You may need to wait for a minute or so before the window comes up.

7 Click Yes. This may also say OK. After doing so, you should notice that your 
  desktop interface is now accessible.

8 Hold down ⊞ Win and tap R. This will bring up the Run tool from which you can 
  complete the fix.

9 Type "rundll32.exe syssetup,SetupOobeBnk" without the quotation marks.
  This command resets the Windows XP trial clock to 30 days.

10 Click OK.

11 Restart your computer. When your welcome screen finishes loading, you should
   be able to log in like usual rather than being stuck in the activation loop.
