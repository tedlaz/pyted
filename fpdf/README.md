Pure Python PDF creation library
================================
This is an easy to use library to create pdf reports.

Reports
-------
- Simple page **report**
- Multiple page table report
- Let me do it again [example](http://www.in.gr)

```Python
import sys
print('this is a test')
for i in range(100):
    print(i)
```

|tables  | Are     | Cool   |
|--------|:-------:|-------:|
|erg     |test     |  121,00|
|pop     |special  |   30,00|

```
again this is something special
and has to do with proper text position
```
Again all i want to do is to check the posibilities of
markdown text.
